Sure! Here's a breakdown of what your code is doing step-by-step:

---

### 1. **Importing libraries**

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

* `pandas` (pd) for data manipulation.
* `seaborn` (sns) for statistical data visualization.
* `matplotlib.pyplot` (plt) for plotting.

---

### 2. **Reading the data**

```python
df = pd.read_csv('netflix.csv')
```

* Loads the Netflix dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame called `df`.

---

### 3. **Preprocessing the data**

* Convert the **Release\_Date** column to datetime format and extract the year.

```python
df['Release_Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Release_Date'], errors='coerce')
df['Year'] = df['Release_Date'].dt.year
```

* Converts the `Release_Date` string to a datetime object.

* Extracts just the year part from the date and stores it in a new column `Year`.

* Extract duration in minutes for movies.

```python
df['Duration_Minutes'] = df['Duration'].str.extract(r'(\d+)').astype(float)
```

* The `Duration` column probably has strings like "90 min" or "1 Season".
* Extracts the numeric part (duration in minutes) and converts it to a float.

---

### 4. **Plotting**

* **Plot 1: Movies vs TV Shows**

```python
sns.countplot(x='Category', data=df)
plt.title('Movies vs TV Shows')
plt.show()
```

* Counts how many titles are Movies and how many are TV Shows.
* Displays a bar chart comparing the counts.

---

* **Plot 2: Titles by Rating**

```python
sns.countplot(x='Rating', data=df, order=df['Rating'].value_counts().index)
plt.title('Titles by Rating')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

* Counts titles by their rating (like PG, R, etc.).
* Orders the bars by the most common ratings.
* Rotates the x-axis labels for better readability.

---

* **Plot 3: Top 10 Countries by Number of Titles**

```python
top_countries = df['Country'].value_counts().head(10)
sns.barplot(y=top_countries.index, x=top_countries.values)
plt.title('Top 10 Countries')
plt.show()
```

* Finds the top 10 countries with the most titles.
* Plots a horizontal bar chart showing these countries and their counts.

---

* **Plot 4: Movie Duration Distribution**

```python
sns.histplot(df[df['Category']=='Movie']['Duration_Minutes'].dropna(), bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Movie Duration (minutes)')
plt.show()
```

* Looks only at movies (`Category == 'Movie'`).
* Plots a histogram showing the distribution of movie durations.
* Adds a KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) curve to show the smoothed distribution.

---

* **Plot 5: Titles Released Per Year**

```python
sns.countplot(x='Year', data=df, order=sorted(df['Year'].dropna().unique()))
plt.title('Titles Released Per Year')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

* Counts how many titles were released each year.
* Orders the x-axis by year.
* Rotates labels for readability.

---

### Summary

Your code loads a Netflix dataset, cleans and preprocesses date and duration information, then creates five visualizations to explore:

* The breakdown of Movies vs TV Shows.
* Distribution of titles by rating.
* Top countries producing Netflix content.
* Distribution of movie durations.
* Number of titles released each year.
